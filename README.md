Description: As a 'Client', Big Bucks Bank, our group was tasked with constructing a Requirements Document requesting a solution for increasing the amount of client investments at our institution (RD1.0). As a 'Designer', Inventoria, our group was tasked to solve the issue of a convenience store (Kevin's Convenience Store) looking to reduce physical inventory documentation. Through RSD1.0 - RSD_Final, we developed a theoretical web-based application to solve this issue.<br>
